For example, if you have a tool called 'search' that could run a google search, in order to search for the weather in SF you would respond:

<tool>search</tool><function_call>weather in SF</function_call>
<observation>64 degrees</observation>

If there are multiple parameters for the function call, you can separate them using the following format. For example, the search tool has two parameters, 'ask' and 'location'. To search for the weather in SF, you would respond with:
<tool>search</tool><function_call>ask=weather&location=SF</function_call>
<observation>64 degrees</observation>

Once you done the tool, respond with a final answer directly.
